The benefits
Weighed beside
My broken eyes
Fading mind

A golden light
Starts to fade
My weaknesses
Are the shade

Close tight
Close tight
Close tight

No more
Daylight
Your shade
Comes from
Your eyes
Your eyes
Shut tight
Tonight
Your shade

Dreams lie
So what
Death comes
Because
You said
To me
Lie still
For eternity

Close tight
Close tight
Close tight
Close tight

Close tight
Close tight
No more
Daylight
Your shade
Comes from
Your eyes
Your eyes
Shut tight
Tonight
Your shade
