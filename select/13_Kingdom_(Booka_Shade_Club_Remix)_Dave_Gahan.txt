Can you feel me coming
Open the door it's only me
I have that desperate feeling
In trouble is where I'm going to be

If there's a kingdom beyond it all
Is there a God who loves us all
Do we believe in love at all
I'm still pretending, I'm not a fool

So in your infinite wisdom
Show me how this life should be
With all your love and glory
Doesn't mean that much to me

If there's a kingdom beyond it all
Is there a God who loves us all
Do we believe in love at all
I'm still pretending, I'm not a fool
